# Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 4 Project
This repository contains six plots and the associated R script files that will generate the plots.  The data for these plots 
comes from the [National Emissions Inventory](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories).  
The plots are stored as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc., and the associated scripts are `plot1.R`, etc.  
A script can be run by sourcing the associated file; the commands are not stored as functions.  
Each script will look for the data as the file `summarySCC_PM25.rds` in the working directory. If it cannot be found, the data will be downloaded and unzipped into the working directory.
